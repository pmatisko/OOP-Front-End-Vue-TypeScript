# OOP Front-End core files - Vue, TypeScript

## Introduction & Motivation

VueJs is an amazing framework making your front-end development a joy. However, when your project gets bigger, you will have to solve 
a lot of issues. Installing many 3rd party packages, tweaking them for your own needs, plus your own packages will create a lot of 
different approaches on how to develop code.

I am a big fan of OOP principles and design patterns. It all helps us create more testable and easy to understand code. 

A few most important principles are

SOLID<br>
SoC - Separation of concerns<br>
IoC - Inversion of control

Files in this repository will make your initial phase of the front-end development easier. It establishes a few nice coding principles and contains 
an IoC container that will handle the inversion of control for you.

TypeScript is a safer and more modern version of JavaScript, so I prefer using it in all my projects. VueJs allows us to use TypeScript as well.
However, Vue components should not do too much of business logic, therefore JS is usually satisfactory.
